You need to clone your plugin.program.valhallawizard folder into here. This must be done using the below information.

To build the repository, first place the add-on source folders for whichever add-ons you'd like to be contained in your Kodi repo inside this repository. For ease of updating included add-ons, the recommended method of doing this is via Git Submodules, which are supported by many Git clients, as well as the Git terminal. If you choose not to use submodules, you'll need to simply copy the source folders directly into this repository.
